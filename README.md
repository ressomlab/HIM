# Hierarchical-Integrative-Model
Hierarchical integrative models for the analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression profiles acquired by RNA-seq. This repository contains the source code and GU datasets to implement the Hierarchical integrative models presented in the BMC Genomics paper "Identification of miRNA-mRNA associations in hepatocellular carcinoma using hierarchical integrative models" by R.S.Varghese, Y Zhou et al.

R code: Hierarchical integrative model.R -- source code for the Hierarchical integrative models

GU datasets:
- mRNA.csv -- matrix of mRNA data
- miRNA.csv -- matrix of miRNA data
- y.csv -- matrix with sample name, disease status and patient ID
